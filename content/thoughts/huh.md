This is my attempt at creating a refuge on the internet. A place where I can explore new & interesting ideas in a public way, while building a cruft of knowledge over time. In a sense, I'm building a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).

This website is built using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), a static-site generator leveraging the powers of `.md`, Obsidian, and Hugo to bring together a magical website that will serve to be my public second brain. I hope you enjoy what comes out of this. 

As an example of what this website can do, check out [this link](/thoughts/backlink) which takes you to a page showcasing backlinks.
